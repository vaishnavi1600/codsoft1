Machine Learning Mini Projects -

This repository contains three beginner-level Machine Learning projects done using Python in Google Colab.  These projects cover basic concepts such as regression, classification, data preprocessing, and model evaluation using scikit-learn.

Project Overview

Credit Card Fraud Detection
- Dataset: [Credit Card Transactions](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Model: Logistic Regression
- Goal: Detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
- Techniques Used:
  - Data preprocessing (null handling, scaling)
  - Train/test split
  - Model training and evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)

Iris Dataset Classification
- Dataset: [Iris Flower Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)
- Model: Logistic Regression / KNN (whichever used)
- Goal: Classify flower species based on petal/sepal features.

Sales Prediction using Python
- Dataset: Custom sales data (or provide source if public)
- Model: Linear Regression
- Goal: Predict future sales values based on past trends.
- Key Features:
  - Feature selection
  - Regression modeling
  - Evaluation using RMSE or RÂ²
